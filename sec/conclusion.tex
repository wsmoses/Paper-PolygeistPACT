\section{Conclusion}
We present \tool, a compilation workflow for importing existing C or C++ code into MLIR and allows polyhedral tools, such as Pluto, to optimize MLIR programs. This enables MLIR to benefit from decades of research in polyhedral compilation. We demonstrate that the code generated by \tool has comparable performance with Clang, enabling unbiased comparisons between transformations built for MLIR and existing polyhedral frameworks. 
Finally, we demonstrate the optimization opportunities enabled by \tool considering two complementary transformations: statement splitting and reduction parallelization. In both cases, \tool achieves better performance than state-of-the-art polyhedral compiler and source-to-source optimizer.

%Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our tool to perform such integration by compiling the Polybench benchmark suite into MLIR and importing Pluto %transformations to run on MLIR programs, which may already lead to some performance improvements over the existing flows thanks to better %integration with the LLVM compiler infrastructure.
